## 8 Queens Game

# Preface

Personal python project. Made in a day
If you don't know what the 8 queens problem is, [here it is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)
This is not a preset of placed queens, and therefore is not a backtracking solution. You as the player place down the pieces and it checks if you managed to complete the puzzle.
This was just a personal project I wanted to make and experiment in making GUIs in Python. 

# Features
* Utilizes the pygame library in order to make the GUI. 
* Requires all 8 queens in order to finish the game
* Has a neat red warning line showing you where there is a conflict

# Issues
* Diagonal error marking is not working as expected. Fix later
